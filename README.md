# Password Generator
A simple Python script that creates random passwords using letters, numbers & special characters.

# Uses
Creates random or customized passwords for users. It helps users create stronger passwords that provide greater security. 

# Setup
You need `python>3.8` to run this script.
This script uses both the `random` and `string` modules.

# How it runs
Script can be run in the command-line using ```python password_generator.py```
Once it runs it will produce the random generated password. The length can be between 8 & 20 characters long. Lastly, After the password has been generated it will be stored with a text file(```used_passwords.txt```).

# Side Note
This is my very first project with Python. I know there are probably dozens of ways to make this script more efficient but, You have to start somewhere.
